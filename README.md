# JavaScript Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my JavaScript projects portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to strengthen my foundational skills in JavaScript programming.

## Projects Overview

1. **Currency Converter**
   - **Description:** The Currency Converter project is a web application that allows users to convert between different currencies. It utilizes real-time exchange rate data from a currency API to perform accurate conversions. Users can input an amount in one currency and select another currency to see the equivalent amount based on the current exchange rate.
   - **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (API integration)

2. **Random Password Generator**
   - **Description:** The Random Password Generator project is a tool that generates secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria. Users can specify the length of the password and select options such as including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool provides a randomized password that can be used for enhanced security.
   - **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

3. **Rock-Papers-Scissors Game**
   - **Description:** The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a classic game implemented as a web application. Users can play against the computer by selecting one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer also randomly selects an option, and the winner is determined based on the game rules. This project demonstrates basic JavaScript logic and user interaction.
   - **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Event listeners)
  
4. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   - **Description:** The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a two-player game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game includes features such as detecting winning conditions, preventing invalid moves, and displaying game outcomes. This project showcases JavaScript logic for game mechanics and user interface interactions.
   - **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Event listeners)

## Motivation and Skills Development

The motivation behind developing these projects was to build a strong foundation in JavaScript programming and front-end development. By working on these projects, I honed my skills in:

- Writing clean and efficient JavaScript code
- Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) for dynamic web interactions
- Implementing API integrations for real-time data retrieval
- Enhancing user experience through responsive and visually appealing designs

## Next Steps

I am excited to further expand my skills and contribute to innovative projects that leverage JavaScript and front-end technologies. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me!
